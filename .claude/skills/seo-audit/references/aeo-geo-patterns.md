## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Patterns

### Definition Block

## What is Answer Engine Optimization?

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of structuring content so AI-powered systems can easily extract and present it as direct answers to user queries. Unlike traditional SEO that focuses on ranking in search results, AEO optimizes for featured snippets, AI Overviews, and voice assistant responses. This approach has become essential as over 60% of Google searches now end without a click.

## How to Optimize Content for Featured Snippets

Earning featured snippets requires strategic formatting and direct answers to search queries.

1. **Identify snippet opportunities**: Use tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to find keywords where competitors have snippets you could capture.
2. **Match the snippet format**: Analyze whether the current snippet is a paragraph, list, or table, and format your content accordingly.
3. **Answer the question directly**: Provide a clear, concise answer (40-60 words for paragraph snippets) immediately after the question heading.
4. **Add supporting context**: Expand on your answer with examples, data, and expert insights in the following paragraphs.
5. **Use proper heading structure**: Place your target question as an H2 or H3, with the answer immediately following.

Most featured snippets appear within 2-4 weeks of publishing well-optimized content.
