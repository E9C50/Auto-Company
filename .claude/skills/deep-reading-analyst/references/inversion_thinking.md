# Inversion Thinking Framework

## Overview

Inversion is a powerful mental tool: instead of asking "how to succeed?", ask "how to fail?" then avoid those failure modes.

**Core Principle**: "Invert, always invert." — Carl Jacobi (German mathematician)

## When to Use

Ideal for:
- 🎯 Mitigating risks and avoiding failure
- 🔍 Discovering hidden problems and obstacles
- 💡 Breaking through mental blocks
- ⚠️ Stress-testing plans for fragility
- 🛡️ Building defensive strategies

## Three Inversion Modes

### 1. Goal Inversion

**Forward**: How to achieve goal X?
**Inverted**: How to guarantee failure to achieve X?

```markdown
## Goal Inversion Analysis

Forward Goal: [Article's main recommendation]

Inverted Questions:
1. What behaviors guarantee failure?
2. Which factors completely sabotage the plan?
3. What's the worst possible outcome?

Insights:
- Must-avoid behaviors: [List]
- Critical risk points: [Identify]
- Defensive strategy: [Formulate]
```

### 2. Assumption Inversion

**Forward**: If assumption A holds, then conclusion B is valid
**Inverted**: What happens if assumption A doesn't hold?

```markdown
## Assumption Inversion Test

Article's core assumptions:
1. [Assumption 1]
2. [Assumption 2]
3. [Assumption 3]

Inversion Test:
- If assumption 1 is reversed, how does the conclusion change?
- Under what conditions does this assumption fail?
- Are there counterexamples?

Discovered vulnerabilities: [List]
```

### 3. Causality Inversion

**Forward**: A causes B (cause to effect)
**Inverted**: To get B, what must be true? (effect to cause)

```markdown
## Causality Inversion

Desired Outcome: [Article's promised result]

Backward Derivation:
- To achieve this, what conditions must be met?
- Are all these conditions mentioned in the article?
- What critical factors are missing?

Necessary Conditions:
✓ [Met conditions]
✗ [Unmentioned necessary conditions] ← Important discovery
```

## Application Method

### Step 1: Identify Forward Claims

```markdown
## Article's Forward Claims

Core thesis: [Extract]
Recommended actions: [List]
Expected results: [Describe]
```

### Step 2: Apply Four Inversion Questions

#### ❌ Q1: How to guarantee failure?

```markdown
Most effective failure methods:
1. [Opposite of recommendations]
2. [Ignored critical factors]
3. [Problems from over-execution]

Insight: Avoid these traps
```

#### ⚠️ Q2: When would the advice backfire?

```markdown
Backfire scenarios:
- Wrong timing: [Explain]
- Wrong context: [Explain]
- Insufficient resources: [Explain]

Prerequisites: [Unstated but necessary conditions]
```

#### 🔍 Q3: What risks are missing?

```markdown
Risks article doesn't mention:
