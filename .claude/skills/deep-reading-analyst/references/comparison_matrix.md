## Viewpoint Spectrum

When sources represent different positions on a spectrum:

```markdown
# Viewpoint Spectrum: [Topic]

## The Question
[Central question being debated]

## The Spectrum

[Extreme Position A] ←―――――――――――→ [Extreme Position B]
        ↑                    ↑                    ↑
    [Source 1]          [Source 2]          [Source 3]

### Position A (Source 1)

## Evolution Over Time Matrix

When tracking how understanding of a topic evolved:

```markdown
# Evolution of Thought: [Topic]

| Period | Representative Source | Key Insight | What Changed Next |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Era 1] | [Source/Author] | [Prevailing view] | [Paradigm shift] |
| [Era 2] | [Source/Author] | [New understanding] | [Next shift] |
| [Era 3] | [Source/Author] | [Current view] | [Open questions] |

## Pattern Analysis

## Interdisciplinary Comparison

When same topic is analyzed from different fields:

```markdown
# Multi-Disciplinary View: [Topic]

| Discipline | Source | Core Question | Key Findings | Limitations |
|------------|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Economics | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Psychology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Sociology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Biology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |

## Synthesis
**Complementary insights:**
- Economics sees [X], Psychology explains [Y], together they reveal [Z]

**Contradictions:**
- [Field A] assumes [X], but [Field B] shows [not-X]
- Resolution: [How to reconcile]

**Blind spots filled:**
