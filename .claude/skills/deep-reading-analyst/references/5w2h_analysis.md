2. What are the key claims/conclusions?
3. What solutions are proposed?
4. What core concepts are involved?
5. What are the expected outcomes?

**Deep Inquiry**:

**Five Whys Technique**:
Ask "why" 5 times to reach root cause:
```
Problem: [Surface issue]
→ Why 1: [First layer]
  → Why 2: [Second layer]
    → Why 3: [Third layer]
      → Why 4: [Fourth layer]
        → Why 5: [Root cause] ← Real issue
```

**Process Mapping**:
```

                         ↓ Yes / ↓ No
                    [Step 2A]  [Step 2B]
                         ↓         ↓
                    [Step 3] ← [Converge]
                         ↓
                    [End]
