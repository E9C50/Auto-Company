## Keyword Research Methodology

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Keyword research is the foundation of SEO strategy. Target the wrong keywords and everything downstream fails — great content that nobody searches for, or high-volume terms you'll never rank for.

### Keyword Research Process

```
1. Seed Keywords
   └── Start with 5-10 core terms your business owns

2. Expansion
   └── Tools, competitors, related searches, questions

3. Classification
   └── Intent, funnel stage, topic cluster

4. Prioritization
   └── Volume × Intent × Achievability

5. Mapping
   └── Assign keywords to content pieces
```

### Keyword Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Means | How to Use |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Search Volume** | Monthly searches | Ceiling for traffic potential |
| **Keyword Difficulty** | Competition level (0-100) | Realistic ranking potential |
| **CPC** | What advertisers pay | Proxy for commercial value |
| **Click Potential** | % of searches that click | Beware zero-click queries |
| **Trend** | Volume direction | Growing > declining keywords |
| **SERP Features** | What appears in results | Affects CTR and strategy |

### Keyword Difficulty Guidelines

| Difficulty Score | Site Requirement | Timeline |
|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **0-20** | New sites can rank | 1-3 months |
| **21-40** | Some authority needed | 3-6 months |
| **41-60** | Established domain | 6-12 months |
| **61-80** | Strong authority | 12-18 months |
| **81-100** | Major brand/site | 18+ months or avoid |

### Seed Keyword Sources

| Source | Example | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Product features** | "API key rotation" | Product-led content |
| **Customer problems** | "how to prevent data breaches" | Problem-aware audience |
| **Competitor analysis** | Terms competitors rank for | Gap identification |
| **Sales conversations** | What prospects ask about | High-intent terms |
| **Support tickets** | Common questions | FAQ and help content |
| **Industry terms** | "secrets management" | Category content |

### Good Keyword Research

```
✓ Primary keyword: "kubernetes secrets management"
  └── Volume: 1,200/mo
  └── Difficulty: 35
  └── Intent: Commercial investigation
  └── CPC: $15 (high commercial value)
  └── SERP analysis: Mix of how-tos and comparisons
  └── Opportunity: No clear winner, guides are outdated

✓ Secondary keywords (same page):
  └── "k8s secrets best practices" (480/mo)
  └── "kubernetes secret management tools" (320/mo)
  └── "how to manage secrets in kubernetes" (260/mo)

✓ Related questions to answer:
  └── "Should you store secrets in kubernetes?"
  └── "What is the best way to manage kubernetes secrets?"
  └── "Kubernetes secrets vs external secrets"
```

### Bad Keyword Research

```
✗ Target: "security"
  └── Volume: 1,000,000/mo
  └── Difficulty: 95
  └── Problem: Way too broad, unrankaeable, unclear intent

✗ Target: "infisical vs competitor nobody knows"
  └── Volume: 10/mo
  └── Problem: No search demand exists

✗ Target: "buy secrets management software now"
  └── Volume: 0/mo
  └── Problem: Not how people search
